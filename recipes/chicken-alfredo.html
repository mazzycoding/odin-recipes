    <H2>Steps</H2>
    
    <ol>
       <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
       <li>Season chicken with a pinch of salt and pepper. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken and cook until no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, 7 to 10 minutes.</li>
       <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
       <li>Meanwhile, add Alfredo sauce to the chicken; season to taste with Italian seasoning, garlic powder, onion, basil, salt, black pepper, onion powder, and cayenne.</li>
       <li>Bring to a simmer; stir in Parmesan cheese. Cook mixture until cheese is melted and you are able to lift a spoon out of the sauce without cheese hanging onto it, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
       <li>Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add broccoli, cover, and steam until tender, 2 to 6 minutes.</li>
       <li>Add broccoli to sauce.</li>
       <li>Drain cooked pasta. Scoop into individual serving bowls and pour sauce on top.</li> 
    </ol>
